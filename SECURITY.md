# Security Policy

**Repository:** `dpn-rest-federator-gateway`  
**Description:** `Details the responsible disclosure process for security vulnerabilities.`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `OGL-UK-3.0`  

## Responsible Disclosure 

The National Energy System Operator (NESO) follows a **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** process to ensure security risks are addressed responsibly. 

By reporting security vulnerabilities through the responsible channels, you agree to: 
- Not disclose details of the vulnerability publicly until NESO has had a reasonable opportunity to fix it. 
- Provide NESO with adequate time to assess and mitigate the risk. 
- Act in good faith and follow ethical security research principles. 

NESO reserves the right to take necessary action against unauthorised or harmful security testing activities.

## Reporting Security Issues 

NESO takes security seriously and encourages responsible reporting of vulnerabilities. 

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, **please do not report it publicly**. Instead, follow the steps below to disclose the issue responsibly. 

### **How to Report a Security Issue** 

1. **Do not open a public issue on GitHub.** Instead, report security concerns via email to **[dsi@neso.energy](mailto:dsi@neso.energy)**.
2. **Provide detailed information about the vulnerability**, including: 
   - A clear description of the issue. 
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability. 
   - Potential impact or risk level. 
   - Any suggested mitigation strategies. 
3. **Allow time for assessment and response.** NESO will review the report and respond within **10 working days** to acknowledge receipt. 
4. **Cooperate with NESO to validate and address the issue.** 

Once a resolution has been identified, NESO may choose to: 
   - **Release a patch** as part of the next scheduled update. 
   - **Issue a security advisory** if the issue is critical. 
   - **Provide acknowledgments** where appropriate (subject to NESO’s disclosure policy).

## Scope 

This security policy applies to: 
- All NESO repositories released as open source. 
- Code, configuration files, and infrastructure deployed as part of NESO’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**. 
- **Third-party dependencies** included within NESO repositories. If you identify a vulnerability in a third-party component that NESO relies on (e.g., outdated libraries or known security flaws in dependencies), we encourage you to report it. 

Out of scope: 
- Issues related to third-party services or software **not used within NESO repositories**. 
- Vulnerabilities in user environments that are unrelated to this repository. 
- Unsolicited security testing or penetration testing without NESO’s explicit permission. 

---

## Security Best Practices 

To help maintain security across NESO repositories, we follow these principles: 
- Dependencies are **scanned and updated regularly** (e.g., using automated tools like Dependabot). 
- Sensitive credentials **must not be included** in public repositories. 
- Security patches are applied in a timely manner, with priority given to critical vulnerabilities. 

For more details, refer to our **Secure Development Guidelines** [Link to internal security policy, if available].
