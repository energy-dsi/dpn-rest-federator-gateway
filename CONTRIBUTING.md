1. Check for an existing issue under [Issues](https://github.com/energy-dsi/dpn-rest-federator-gateway/issues).  
2. Open a new issue if no one has reported it yet. Use one of the provided issue templates.  
3. Provide a clear, detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it if applicable.  
4. Label the issue appropriately (bug, documentation, enhancement, etc.).  

For security-related issues, do not submit a public issue. Instead, follow our [Responsible Disclosure process](./SECURITY.md).

## NESO's Approach to Open-Source Development  

- **All NESO code is publicly available under open-source licences.**  
- **Development is led by approved suppliers and partners** who have been engaged through a formal process.  
- **We welcome feedback and ideas**, but implementation is subject to programme priorities.  

To see what we’re working on, check out our [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/energy-dsi). If no roadmap is currently available, please note that it is being actively developed and will be published in due course.

## Branching Strategy  

This repository follows a **GitFlow-based branching model** to manage development efficiently. Key conventions include:  

- **Main Branch (`main`)**: The stable, production-ready branch. Only tested and approved changes are merged here.  
- **Develop Branch (`develop`)**: The integration branch where features and fixes are merged before reaching `main`.  
- **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**: Used for new developments. Named based on functionality, e.g., `feature/new-auth-method`.  
- **Bugfix Branches (`bugfix/*`)**: Address minor issues in `develop` before release.  
- **Release Branches (`release/*`)**: Used to prepare a new stable release, ensuring final testing and versioning updates.  
- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**: Critical fixes applied directly to `main` and merged back into `develop`.

## Pull Request Policy  

To maintain high-quality contributions, NESO enforces the following **minimum pull request (PR) requirements** for approved contributors:  

- **All PRs must be reviewed by at least one maintainer** before merging.
- **PRs should reference a corresponding issue** where applicable.
- **Code changes must include relevant tests** to ensure stability.
- **Commit messages should follow best practices**, including referencing issue numbers when relevant.
- **Documentation updates should accompany PRs that impact functionality.**
- **PRs should use "squash and merge" as the preferred merge strategy**, ensuring a clean history.
- **Feature and bugfix branches should be deleted after merge** to keep the repository tidy.
- **Force pushing to the `main` branch is strictly prohibited** to protect repository integrity.
- **CI builds must pass before merging** to enforce basic validation checks.
